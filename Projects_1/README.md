# Sorting Methods Project

This project implements various sorting algorithms in C, alongside a main struct for managing player data.

## Folder Structure
- `1/`: Contains the main struct for handling player data.
- `1.1/`: Binary Search implementation.
- `1.2/`: Recursive Selection Sort implementation.
- `1.3/`: Shell Sort implementation.
- `1.4/`: Quick Sort implementation.
- `1.5/`: Bubble Sort implementation.
- `1.6/`: Radix Sort implementation.

## Struct Principal (Folder `1/`)
The core struct of the project, designed to handle player data read from a file. It serves as the backbone of the application, ensuring efficient data storage, access, and manipulation.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Binary Search (Folder `1.1/`)
A fast and efficient search algorithm implemented for sorted datasets.

### Recursive Selection Sort (Folder `1.2/`)
A recursive version of the selection sort algorithm, showcasing a different approach to sorting.

### Shell Sort (Folder `1.3/`)
An in-place comparison sort that improves the efficiency of insertion sort.

### Quick Sort (Folder `1.4/`)
A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its impressive speed and efficiency.

### Bubble Sort (Folder `1.5/`)
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Radix Sort (Folder `1.6/`)
A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
