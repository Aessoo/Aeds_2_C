# PUC Minas AEDS Projects in C

Welcome to my collection of projects developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms (AEDS) course at PUC Minas. All projects in this repository are implemented in the C programming language.

## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various projects and assignments completed during my AEDS course at PUC Minas. Each project focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm, providing practical experience in C programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these projects, you will need:

- A C compiler, such as GCC
- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aessoo/Aeds_2_C.git
2. Navigate to the specific project directory:
   ```sh
   cd aeds-projects-c/project-directory
3. Compile the C file:
   ```sh
   gcc -o output-filename input-filename.c
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./output-filename
   
## Projects Index

Here, you can list and briefly describe each project in the repository:

1. **Sorting Methods**: This project is an implementation of various sorting algorithms using C. It involves a struct that reads player data from a file. There are 16 different sorting methods implemented, each identified by a unique code and with its own function name. The project serves as a comprehensive practice of sorting algorithms and their efficiency.

2. **Project 2 (In Production)**: This project is currently under development, and more details will be provided upon completion.
